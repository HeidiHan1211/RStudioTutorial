# RStudioTutorial
Script made as part of David Langer's RStudio tutorial. His video has dated R syntax (made Nov. 8th, 2014), so I made small modifications to make it work with Rstudio as of Dec. 4th, 2018 (v1.1.463). Doing this helped me make sure I understood the scripts instead of simply copying them down.

David Langer's tutorial video (very good introduction to R studio and reasoning behind using it in a data science context):
